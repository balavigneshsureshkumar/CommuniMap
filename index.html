                    gather from walking or cycling on their daily routes. The points represent their carbon offset from
                    choosing to walk or cycle over taking private transportation.

                            <li>The project kicked off with a team meeting to discuss about our given project: Active Travel CO2 with GALLANT.</li>
                            <li>The team conducted a brainstorming session to outline the key objectives and deliverables for the project.</li>
                            <li>An initial research was done to know the current context of GALLANT and Glasgow.</li>
                            <h4>Stakeholder Meeting</h4>
                            <li>A meeting was scheduled with Dr Sarah from GALLANT, who will be our main partner and stakeholder in this project.</li>
                            <li>A set of questions was drafted before the meeting to ensure that we were able to get valuable insights from Dr Sarah. The questions were drafted using what we had learnt during the first lecture that includes "How might we..." questions and the Double Diamond method.</li>
                            <li>During the meeting, we discussed the project requirements, expectations, and potential challenges.</li>
                            <li>After the stakeholder meeting, we had a small team meeting to debrief and discuss the key takeaways from the meeting with Dr Sarah to ensure that the whole team is on the same page.</li>

                            <li>First thing the team did today was to divide the tasks and allocate roles for each member to start working on the project.</li>
                            <li>2 main groups of tasks were formed within the team: Prototyping and Video Pitch.</li>
                            <li>Prototyping team was responsible for creating ideas and quick sketches of potential solutions.</li>
                            <li>Video Pitch team was responsible for creating the Weekly Pitch Videos that reflect on what we have learnt from talking to stakeholders and building prototypes.</li>
                            <li>Vignesh, Kee Shen, Bruce and Jovian were assigned to the Prototyping team while Felix and Lin Feng were assigned to the Video Pitch team.</li>
                            <li>While the members have been divided, it was also agreed that the two teams would help one another and be flexible on the roles as needed.</li>
                            <h4>Team Contract</h4>
                            <li>To further ensure our commitment to the team project, a team contract was created and was signed by all members.</li>
                            <li>The team contract includes our team values, communication methods, and expectations for each member.</li>
                            <li>This team contract was subsequently submitted on Moodle.</li>

                            <li>When brainstorming ideas for the project, the team realised that further research is needed based on what was learnt from the meeting with Dr Sarah</li>
                            <li>Further research include the current state of active travel in Glasgow, the incentives or motivations, GALLANT's CommuniMap application and more</li>
                            <li>We dedicated time to fully understand the user needs and pain points before moving on to the ideation phase.</li>

                            <li>To end off the first week of the OIP, the team held a brainstorming session to generate ideas for the prototypes.</li>
                            <li>We used the Double Diamond method to structure our ideation process, focusing on defining the problem and exploring potential solutions.</li>
                            <li>Solutions include how to incentivise and motivate users to do active travel and how to make them more engaged with the CommuniMap applications</li>
                            <li>Potential ideas include gamification of the application, calculating the CO2 emissions saved for their route, rewarding users with shopping vouchers for reaching a certain amount of CO2 saved, and more.</li>
                            <li>While brainstorming, quick sketches were made to visualize the ideas and concepts being discussed.</li>

                            <li>A Powerpoint document was created to facilitate the presentation of our reflection for this week's pitch video.</li>
                            <li>Throughout the ideation process, the team also wrote what we learnt from this process onto the document.</li>
                            <li>What we learnt from talking to Dr Sarah from GALLANT was also written down onto the Powerpoint document.</li>

                            <li>We drew up many different screens based on the discussions and ideations from the previous week. </li>
                            <li>These sketches were created to visualize the ideas and concepts we had discussed, including virtual pet system, routing capabilities, and achievement systems.</li>
                            <li>We focused on how the virtual pet would enhance the active travelling aspect and build an attachment with users, how CO₂ savings would be calculated, and how users could earn points through active travel.</li>
                            <li>These sketches served as the foundation for our prototype development in the coming weeks.</li>

                            <li>Using the main screens of the CommuniMap application, we adapted our ideas into the screens, focusing on the user interface and experience, ensuring that the design was inituitive and engaging</li>
                            <li>We also discussed the flow of our prototype, how the virtual pet, in app currency (CO₂ coins), quests and leaderboards, would be integrated into the application.</li>
                            <li>Prototyping the flow allows us to visualize how the different systems and features work together and evolve based on the user's active travel.</li>

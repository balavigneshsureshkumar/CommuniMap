                        <strong>GALLANT</strong> (Glasgow as a Living Lab Accelerating Novel Transformation) is a
                        University project aiming to design novel ways to adapt to climate change. CommuniMap is a
                        digital tool that acts as a data repository for community science data, allowing users to share
                        travel patterns, map routes, flag barriers, and highlight safe, joyful routes.

                    <h3>Our Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Encouraging people to reduce CO₂ emissions by choosing active travel (walking, cycling, etc) over motorised transport requires more than just tracking their routes; it requires motivation and engagement.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Our Goal</h3>
                    <p>To design a gamified companion solution that leverages data from GALLANT’s CommuniMap Mobile Application to promote active travel and raise awareness of carbon savings. 
                        By externally calculating CO₂ offsets from journey data and incorporating features like leaderboards, group challenges, and social incentives, we aim to engage users through behavior-driven design. 
                        This system will emphasize both measurable environmental impact and trustworthiness in tracking, aligning with stakeholder goals for sustainability, user motivation, and scalable software integration.</p>

                    choosing to walk or cycle over taking private transportation.

                <h3>What We Learnt</h3>
                <p>This is what we have learnt from our 3 weeks of OIP, from talking to stakeholders to building prototypes.</p>
                <div class="proud-essay-container">
                    <h4>Talking to Stakeholders</h4>
                    <li><b>Questions are more important than answers:</b> When talking to Dr Sarah from GALLANT, we found that asking the right questions will reveal the true user needs and constraints
                    on a deeper level. Using "How might we...", "Why...", or "What if" questions will open discussions and allows people to think differently. For example, instead of "Would you use
                    a CO2 tracker?", we used "How might we help users see the impact of their active travel?". We learnt that a well-crafted question helps to unlock genuine insights for useful solutions.
                    The Double Diamond method that we learnt was proved to be useful for questioning about our project.</li>
                    <li><b>Engage with Stakeholders/Users Effectively:</b> During our second partner meeting, we pitched our ideas and asked Dr Sarah for her feedback and insights. She challenged our assumptions, added new considerations 
                    offered new directions. From this, we learnt that Stakeholders is not just about "approval or rejection" of ideas. They are partners throughout the whole design process and should not be 
                    seen as "clients". They offer valuable insights, to a point where we wished we had engaged with them more frequently. Stakeholders co-shape our ideas, not just validate them.</li>
                    <li><b>Clear and Relatable Communication: </b>When presenting our ideas/prototypes, we used real-world examples/analogies/terms to explain our features. For example, we 
                    explained that our Virtual Pet system is similar to a Tamagotchi, Navigation feature is similar to Google Maps. We learnt that this helps to connect with the stakeholder/user's experience 
                    and mental model which enables us to design with the average user's perspective. This communication style allowed the stakeholder/user to understand and respond more meaningfully. In return, 
                    we get more meaningful insights/feedback.</li>
                    <h4>Building Prototypes</h4>
                    <li><b>Every team member's perspective needs to be heard: </b>We found that each member brings different experiences, biases, strengths and intuition. The different viewpoints 
                    helps to uncover blind spots in our design. We learnt that while getting the users' perspectives is important, getting the team's perspectives is equally important in making a viable solution. 
                    We want our prototype to try to satisfy all perspectives. While we acknowledge that it is impossible to satisfy all of them, we want to try to cater to as much as we can and that starts 
                    with getting the different perspectives.</li>
                    <li><b>Mobile-First Design: </b>CommuniMap has both a website companion and a mobile application. Our problem focuses on walking/cycling which forces the focus to be on the mobile application design as it 
                    would be impossible to walk/cycle with a laptop. What we learnt from this is that we would need to take note of the mobile phone's resources such as screen constraints. Are the buttons too big or too small? 
                    Are the words legible? This shifted the team's mentality to take into account the User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX), not just the functionality of the gamification.</li>
                    <li><b>Sketch-based/Paper-based Prototyping is Effective: </b>The main prototyping method we used in our project is sketch-based prototyping where we created wireframes of the user interfaces and flow. 
                    We found this method to be quick and easy to create and make changes as all it takes is just a pencil and paper. We learnt that this allows us to have a quick visual representation of the mobile 
                    application interface such as the buttons, bars, etc. Through this, we are able to get fast feedback and have multiple quick interations for prototyping. We also found it easy to mix-and-match elements to test 
                    concepts early. Elements were tested based on visual and functional feasibility. The quickness of this method allowed us to know if are on the right track at each iteration.</li>

                            <h4>Project Requirement Gathering</h4>
                            <li>The project kicked off with a team meeting to discuss about our given project: Active
                                Travel CO2 with GALLANT.</li>
                            <li>The team conducted a brainstorming session to outline the key objectives and
                                deliverables for the project.</li>
                            <li>An initial research was done to know the current context of GALLANT and Glasgow.</li>
                            <h4>Stakeholder Meeting</h4>
                            <li>A meeting was scheduled with Dr Sarah from GALLANT, who will be our main partner and
                                stakeholder in this project.</li>
                            <li>A set of questions was drafted before the meeting to ensure that we were able to get
                                valuable insights from Dr Sarah. The questions were drafted using what we had learnt
                                during the first lecture that includes "How might we..." questions and the Double
                                Diamond method.</li>
                            <li>During the meeting, we discussed the project requirements, expectations, and potential
                                challenges.</li>
                            <li>After the stakeholder meeting, we had a small team meeting to debrief and discuss the
                                key takeaways from the meeting with Dr Sarah to ensure that the whole team is on the
                                same page.</li>

                            <li>First thing the team did today was to divide the tasks and allocate roles for each
                                member to start working on the project.</li>
                            <li>2 main groups of tasks were formed within the team: Prototyping and Video Pitch.</li>
                            <li>Prototyping team was responsible for creating ideas and quick sketches of potential
                                solutions.</li>
                            <li>Video Pitch team was responsible for creating the Weekly Pitch Videos that reflect on
                                what we have learnt from talking to stakeholders and building prototypes.</li>
                            <li>Vignesh, Kee Shen, Bruce and Jovian were assigned to the Prototyping team while Felix
                                and Lin Feng were assigned to the Video Pitch team.</li>
                            <li>While the members have been divided, it was also agreed that the two teams would help
                                one another and be flexible on the roles as needed.</li>
                            <h4>Team Contract</h4>
                            <li>To further ensure our commitment to the team project, a team contract was created and
                                was signed by all members.</li>
                            <li>The team contract includes our team values, communication methods, and expectations for
                                each member.</li>
                            <li>This team contract was subsequently submitted on Moodle.</li>

                                needed based on what was learnt from the meeting with Dr Sarah</li>
                            <li>Further research include the current state of active travel in Glasgow, the incentives
                                or motivations, GALLANT's CommuniMap application and more</li>

                            <h4>Prototype Ideation</h4>
                            <li>To end off the first week of the OIP, the team held a brainstorming session to generate
                                ideas for the prototypes.</li>
                            <li>We used the Double Diamond method to structure our ideation process, focusing on
                                defining the problem and exploring potential solutions.</li>
                            <li>Solutions include how to incentivise and motivate users to do active travel and how to
                                make them more engaged with the CommuniMap applications</li>
                            <li>Potential ideas include gamification of the application, calculating the CO2 emissions
                                saved for their route, rewarding users with shopping vouchers for reaching a certain
                                amount of CO2 saved, and more.</li>
                            <li>While brainstorming, quick sketches were made to visualize the ideas and concepts being
                                discussed. </li>
                            <h4>Pitch Video 1</h4>
                            <li>A Powerpoint document was created to facilitate the presentation of our reflection for
                                this week's pitch video.</li>
                            <li>Throughout the ideation process, the team also wrote what we learnt from this process
                                onto the document.</li>
                            <li>What we learnt from talking to Dr Sarah from GALLANT was also written down onto the
                                Powerpoint document.</li>
                            <li>Subsequently, the team reviewed the document and recorded it as a voiceover video for
                                submission on Moodle.</li>

                            <li>These sketches were created to visualize the ideas and concepts we had discussed,
                                including virtual pet system, routing capabilities, and achievement systems.</li>
                            <li>We focused on how the virtual pet would enhance the active travelling aspect and build
                                an attachment with users, how CO₂ savings would be calculated, and how users could earn
                                points through active travel.</li>
                            <li>These sketches served as the foundation for our prototype development in the coming

                            <h4>Sketches to Figma</h4>
                            <li>We took the sketches created yesterday and started to digitize them using Figma.</li>
                            <li>Using the main screens of the CommuniMap application, we adapted our ideas into the
                                screens, focusing on the user interface and experience, ensuring that the design was
                                inituitive and engaging</li>
                            <li>We also discussed the flow of our prototype, how the virtual pet, in app currency (CO₂
                                coins), quests and leaderboards, would be integrated into the application.</li>
                            <li>Prototyping the flow allows us to visualize how the different systems and features work
                                together and evolve based on the user's active travel.</li>

                            <h4>Start of Poster and Website</h4>
                            <li>We started working on the project poster and website to showcase our progress and ideas.
                            </li>
                            <li>A Canva document was made for the poster and a GitHub repository was made for the website. Both were shared among the team members.</li>
                            <li>The poster was designed to highlight our project goals, the problem we are addressing,
                                and the solutions we are proposing.</li>
                            <li>The website was created to provide a platform for sharing our project development
                                journey and reflections.</li>
                            <li>We experimented with different designs, aesthetics, and layouts to see which
                                combinations best fit with the nature of our prototype</li>

                            <h4>Stakeholder Meeting 2</h4>
                            <li>We had a second meeting with Dr Sarah to present our initial ideas and sketches.</li>
                            <li>During the meeting, we presented our sketches and presented on the different ideas and
                                prototypes we created.</li>
                            <li>We also discussed the potential challenges and limitations of our proposed solutions,
                                including how to ensure that our prototype can be progressed in different phases to ease
                                users with the ideas we introduced</li>
                            <li>During the meeting, we also asked about the colour scheme of the application, to which Dr Sarah responded that it should follow the brand guidelines.</li>
                            <li>A mini "Usability Testing" session was also done with Dr Sarah to see how an average user would interact and react with our interfaces.</li>
                            <li>After the meeting, we had a team debrief to discuss the feedback and how we could
                                incorporate it into our prototype development.</li>
                            <h4>Feedback from Stakeholders</h4>
                            <li>We received positive feedback on our initial ideas and sketches, especially with the
                                virtual pet and route finder ideas</li>
                            <li>Dr Sarah appreciated our focus on user experience and the potential of the virtual pet
                                system to help users build an attachment to the app.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, she said that the current userbase would highly favour towards the route
                                finder idea</li>
                            <li>Dr Sarah also highlighted the relationship building aspect of the app, emphasizing the
                                importance of kepping momentum in retention of users</li>
                            <li>We also talked about the importance of making the CO₂ savings calculation transparent
                                and easy to understand for users.</li>
                            <li>Overall, the feedback was constructive and helped us refine our ideas further.</li>

                            <li>We took the feedback from Dr Sarah and started to improve our prototypes, poster, and
                                website.</li>
                            <li>We focused on improving the virtual pet aspect, as it was the novel idea which could be
                                introduced early to help build relationship with users</li>
                           <li>Upon redesigning our early prototype to better align with the GALLANT brand guidelines, we encountered a design block—struggling to finalize the colour scheme, font choices, and overall design direction despite having access to the brand assets.</li> 
                           <li>To overcome this, we created multiple design variations featuring different colour palettes, typography, and layouts. After reviewing and discussing them as a team, we conducted a group vote to select the most suitable option.</li> 
                           <li>Following that, we emailed Dr. Sarah to seek her feedback on the selected design, particularly regarding the colour palette and overall design preference.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, we made improvements to the poster and website, adding more details from
                                our journey so far and ensuring that they effectively communicated our project goals and
                                progress.</li>

                                the first Pitch Video.</li>
                            <li>This second Pitch Video includes a reflection from our second meeting with Dr Sarah from
                                GALLANT and from building our sketch-based and Figma prototypes.</li>
                            <li>When making this second Pitch Video, we incorporated feedback based on Pitch Video 1's
                                assessment which was assessed by our Teaching Assistant and Professor. Improvements
                                include showing our prototype and the prototyping process.</li>
                            <li>Subsequently, the team reviewed the document and recorded it as a voiceover video for
                                submission on Moodle.</li>

                            <li>We conducted usability testing with a small group of users to gather feedback on our
                                prototype, giving them a list of tasks to execute.</li>
                            <li>During the testing, we observed how users interacted with the prototype and gathered
                                their feedback on the user interface, features, and overall experience.</li>
                            <li>Based on the feedback, many expressed positively to the virtual pet idea, praising its
                                aesthetics and appeal.</li>

                                    prototype</a></li>
                            <li>Overall improvements were on the aesthetics and layout</li>
                            <li>We also made final adjustments to the descriptions in the poster, ensuring that it
                                effectively communicated our prototype's goals.</li>
                            <h4>Feedback from Teaching Assistants</h4>
                            <li>We approached our Teaching Assistant Martin and Professor Ryo for feedback on our poster.</li>
                            <li>The feedback we received was that our thought process could be made clearer and more
                                obvious to help readers understand the intentions behind our designs</li>
                            <li>The feedback was constructive and helped us refine our ideas further.</li>
                            <li>We discussed the feedback as a team and made adjustments to our prototype and poster
                                based on the suggestions.</li>
                            <li>This iterative process of feedback and refinement is crucial and helped us to ensure
                                that our final prototype meets the project requirements, objectives, user needs.</li>

                <p>Read our essay about what we are proud of, or not proud of, about our work</p>
                <div class="proud-essay-container">
                    <h4>Project Background</h4>
                    <p>Our project mainly revolves around GALLANT's CommuniMap application and encouraging users to take up active travel
                        instead of motorised vehicles. The purpose is to reduce CO₂ emissions within the city of Glasgow and raising awareness
                        of the CO₂ emissions saved. This project has given us the experience of many emotions and types of challenges. The multi-cultural 
                        and cross-national nature of the project has broadened our view.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Team Dynamics and Adaptation</h4>
                    <p>Despite having prior experience working together, we had to adapt to a new environment. The team had to 
                        adjust to different working styles and communication methods, which was initially challenging. However, 
                        effective collaboration and understanding helped us overcome these hurdles.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Collaboration with Dr. Sarah (Key Stakeholder)</h4>
                    <p>Working with Dr. Sarah, a key stakeholder in the GALLANT project, has been an incredibly positive experience. 
                        She has been exceptionally supportive and generous with her time, helping us gain a deeper understanding of user requirements through face-to-face meetings and prompt, thoughtful responses to our unscheduled emails. 
                        Her insights into the habits and challenges of CommuniMap users have been invaluable to the development of our project.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Adapting to Glasgow's Lifestyle and Culture</h4>
                    <p>This project was a novel experience for us as there was no similar app back in Singapore. We had to adapt 
                        our thinking to fit the Glasgow lifestyle, understanding local transportation habits and roadblocks by 
                        spending time in the city.

                            <li><p><strong>The Final Prototype</strong><br>
                            We are proud of the gamified version of the CommuniMap application that we created. 
                            The prototype allows users to engage with virtual pets, forming a fun and motivating relationship 
                            that encourages user to use the app more consistently.</p>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><p><strong>Team Collaboration</strong><br>
                            The collaborative effort from every team member was key to our success. Each person brought 
                            their unique skills and perspectives, helping us create a cohesive and engaging prototype. We iterated 
                            on our designs multiple times, ensuring that the final product was both user-friendly and visually appealing.</p>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><p><strong>Effort and Dedication</strong><br>
                            We are proud of the effort and dedication we invested in this project. We worked tirelessly to ensure that our 
                            prototype met the project's objectives and aligned with the requirements.</p>
                            </li>

                    <h4>What We Are Not Proud Of</h4>
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><strong>Time and Resource Constraints</strong><br>
                            We feel it could have been enhanced with more time and resources. Due to time limitations, we had to compromise 
                            on certain features and functionalities, which we believe could have been more polished with additional work.</p>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><p><strong>Focus Narrowing</strong><br>
                            Dr. Sarah provided valuable feedback, noting that our initial ideas were all very good. Due to the time 
                            constraints, we had to focus on just one idea for the final prototype, which mean some of the original vision 
                            couldn't be fully realized.</p>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><p><strong>Room for Improvement</strong><br>
                            We recognize that there's always room for growth. We acknowledge that the design process is an ongoing journey,
                            and with more time and resources, we could refine and improve the prototype even further.</p>
